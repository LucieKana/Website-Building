# Website-Building
Build a responsive website with HTML,CSS and Javascript


Project Details

Must have at least three pages, one of which should be a contact page or feedback page that uses a form 
Create a wireframe outlining the look and feel of your website (can use wireframe.cc or app.diagrams.net to make it digital)
Design your website using a CSS Grid or FlexBox layout or a combination of both.
Make it as responsive as possible by adding media queries to complement your CSS  layout
Use the fetch method to make an asynchronous call to a third-party API. This API should be related to your project in some way
Use the data you get back to add content to your web pages with what you've learned in JavaScript
Add your personal touch or style to the CSS 
Push your project to GitHub, make commits often, and deploy your website using GitHub Pages
Add a README file that clearly documents the purpose of the project as a problem statement, the target end-user for this program, and has an embedded link (not URL) to your live site. Must use Markdown in your README. 
Here is a link for Markdown for your reference:

Be approximately 5 minutes in length
Show off all features of the app
Use technical terminology while presenting your project
Explain the technical challenges
Explain which improvements you might make
Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.

How to Submit Your Project
Submit your GitHub link.
You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.

Where to go for help during project week
Seek out help online
Seek out help with your classmates
Seek out help with the instruction team
Suggested Ways to Get Started
Wireframe Make a drawing of what your website will look like 

Break the project down into different components (the different pages of your website)

Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

Consult documentation resources (MDN, w3schools, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

Creativity
Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end-user?

Code Quality
Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you add comments in your code as your instructors have in class?

Problem Solving
Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
